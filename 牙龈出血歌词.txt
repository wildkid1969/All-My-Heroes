We wll miss your bright eyes and sweet smile 
For I know you are taking in the sunshine

There's no train for leavin 
There's no home for sleeping 
It's time to start n' begin

The first one's right will always green 
There's a light in forest 
There's a face in the force

Theracy ！wake up the dead wake up the blooshed 
Theracy ！dance around in your bones ! 

7 The youth way 

recorded in 2008 


This is the poor youth This is the way 
This is the sun of the 9 o'clock 
This is working class This is the punx 
This is the hope over the world 

The youth way is vibrant 
The youth way will change the world 
The youth way is vibrant 
Shoulder the hope for future 

We are the poor youth We are the way 
We are the sun of the 9 o'clock 
We are working class We are the punx 
We are the hope over the world 

The youth way is vibrant 
The youth way will change the world 
The youth way is vibrant 
Shoulder the hope for future 

This is the poor youth This is the way 
This is the sun of the 9 o'clock 
We are working class We are the punx 
We are the new generation ! 

The youth way is vibrant 
The youth way will change the world 
The youth way is vibrant 
Shoulder the hope for future 

8 Tomorrow will be once again 

recorded in 2009 

I was growing here 
Singing child songs 
Playing games through the years 
But the war was coming 
The cruel youth coming 
We had to passive leave 

Do you remember 
Those simple oaths 
And the loss of sky and clouds 
My memories 
My dear you 
Carved in my bones 

We will take you in heart 
We will take you in mind 
Tomorrow will be once again 
We will take you in heart 
We will take you in hand 
Until the end of the road 

Those were happy days 
Those of cold morning 
Those mama's reminder 
Those forever young 

Those love and quarrel 
Those struggle and growth 
It's time to start and rebel 
Nothing can stop the boy 

歌词大意： 

明天会重来一遍 

我在这里成长 
唱儿童歌曲 
一路嬉笑玩耍 
可是后来战争来了 
残酷的青春来了 
我们被动的离开 

还记得吗？ 
那些单纯热情的誓言 
还有失去的白云蓝天 
我的记忆 
我的亲爱的你们 
都刻在了我的骨子里 

我把你放在心里 
我把你放在心上 
明天会重来一遍 
我把你放在心里 
我把你放在掌心 
直到旅途的尽头 

那些个欢乐的日子 
那些个清冷的早晨 
那些个妈妈的叮咛 
那些个永远的年轻 

那些个爱情与争吵 
那些个挣扎与成长 
已是时候开始和反抗 
一切都阻挡不了男孩儿 

10 Utopia song 

recorded in 2008 

Time have cut the memories 
Love will tear us above us 
Peace was installed by bloody wars 
Stars still shine the people's land 

So many years 
Sing for the utopia 
All my dreams were never broken down 
So many tears 
Forever utopia 
Music down , they always carry on 

歌词大意： 

乌托邦之歌 

时间撕碎了所有的回忆 
热爱让我们哭泣让我们凝聚 
和平在血腥的战争后被安置秩序 
星光仍然照耀着人民的土地 

多少年来 为乌托邦而歌唱 
我们的所有梦想从没有泯灭 
多少眼泪 永恒的乌托邦 
音乐停止了 他们会一直继续 

11 Let go 

music by Mr. Irish Bastard 
vocal by Gum Bleed (Chinese parts) & Mr. Irish Bastard (English parts) 
from Mr. Irish Bastard album "Fortune & Glaory" 

When you feel lonely and coldly 
look at your face 
Do not let the tears of remorse 
Blur your eyes 
Your crossness and youth 
never be concealed 
Recalled in the dark of night 
all of the memories 

And you know C your memories will fade away 
But you got to let go 

Dream on your mind 
We'll be together 
until the end of the road 
We'll be together 
Years won't change 
Your still young face 
Ball and Chain will be open in the final 
A bright, brand new day 

And you know C your memories will fade away 
But you got to let go 

When we start to miss 
our young hearts 
When we begin to recall 
our young songs 
never stop over 
The pace of our progress 
Let the bright songs 
Throughout the valley of the Dawn 

当你孤单冷落时 看看你的脸 
别让懊悔的泪水 模糊了双眼 
你的固执和青春 并不曾遮掩 
在黑夜中回忆起 所有的思念 

但是你知道 你的记忆会消失 但你仍需上路 

你把梦放在心里 我们在一起 
直到旅途的尽头 我们在一起 
岁月不会改变你 还年轻的脸 
锁链终会被打开 光明的一天 

当我们想念起 我们年轻的心 
当我们回忆起 我们年轻的歌 
永远停不下 我们前进的步伐 
让光明的歌 响彻山谷的黎明
